# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.

## Files

- `gameController.cpp` and `gameController.h`: These files contain the `gameController` class, which controls the game logic.
- `board.cpp` and `board.h`: These files contain the `board` class, which represents the game board.
- `main.cpp`: This is the entry point of the program.

## Gameplay

The game starts by displaying the game board with numbered positions. Players take turns entering the position where they want to place their mark. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'. The game continues until one player has three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until all positions on the board have been filled, in which case the game is a draw.
